abstract = {This study investigates the impacts of continuous delivery practices in organizations. Continuous delivery is a set of practices designed to optimize the process of taking changes from version control to production or release to manufacturing. Key elements include comprehensive use of version control, automation of the test and deployment process, and the application of continuous integration to rapidly validate the correctness of every change through running the automated build and test process. When viewed through the lens of organizational capabilities theory, CD is an inside-out spanning process. We propose that the use of CD in organizations affects factors that impact the tech workforce today (e.g., perceived burnout and deployment pain), and software delivery performance (e.g., change fail rates and IT performance). We also propose that it indirectly influences organizational performance through IT performance (which is itself a spanning process). We empirically test our model with survey data collected from 4,976 respondents around the world, and find that our hypotheses are supported. The paper's implications for research and practice are discussed.},

Available : Eero Retrieved : 27 ABSTRACT Context : Continuous delivery (CD) is a development prac - tice for decreasing the time - to - market by keeping software releasable all the time . Adopting CD within a stage - gate managed development process might be useful , although sci - entific evidence of such adoption is not available . In a stage - gate process , new releases pass through stages and gates protect low - quality output from progressing . Large organi - zations with stage - gate processes are often hierarchical and the adoption can be either top - down , driven by the manage - ment , or bottom - up , driven by the development unit . Goal : We investigate the perceived problems of bottom - up CD adoption in a large global software development unit at Nokia Networks . Our goal is to understand how the stage - gate development process used by the unit affects the adop - tion . Method : The overall research approach is a qualitative single case study on one of the several geographical sites of the development unit . We organized two 2 - hour workshops with altogether 15 participants to discover how the stage - gate process affected the adoption . Results : The stage - gate development process caused tight schedules for development and process overhead because of the gate requirements . Moreover , the process required us - ing multiple version control branches for different stages in the process , which increased development complexity and caused additional branch overhead . Together , tight sched - ule , process overhead and branch overhead caused the lack of time to adopt CD . In addition , the use of multiple branches limited the available hardware resources and caused delayed integration . Conclusions : Adopting CD in a development organiza - tion that needs to conform to a stage - gate development pro - cess is challenging . Practitioners should either gain support from the management to relax the required process or reduce their expectations on what can be achieved while conform - ing to the process . To simplify the development process , the use of multiple version control branches could be replaced with feature toggles .},

@article{Humble2015,
abstract = {One of the major aims of this book is to improve collaboration between the people responsible for delivering software. In particular, we have in mind developers, testers, systems and database administrators, and managers. We cover topics from traditional configuration management, source code control, release planning, auditing, compliance, and integration to the automation of your building, testing, and deployment processes. We also describe techniques such as automated acceptance testing, dependency management, database migration, and the creation and management of testing and production environments. Many people involved in creating software consider these activities secondary to writing code. However, in our experience they take up a great deal of time and effort, and are critical to successful software delivery. When the risks surrounding these activities are not managed adequately, they can end up costing a lot of money, often more than the cost of building the software in the first place.},

@article{Lai2015,
abstract = {In order to project resource manage and time control, large or complex software system need be modularized. Software system is decomposed into subsystems, functional modules and basis components. Finally, all tested components have to integrate to be the complete system. Applying IID (Interactive Incremental Development) mechanism, agile development model becomes the practical method to reduce software project failure rate. Continuous integration (CI) is an IID implementation concept which can effectively reduce software development risk. Web app with high change characteristic is suitable to use agile development model as the development methodology. The paper depth surveys CI operating environment and advantages. Introducing CI concept can make up the development change impacts of Web app. For this, the paper proposes a Web Applications Continuous Integration Procedure (WACIP) to assist the system integration operating. WACIP with CI makes Web app can be deployed quickly, increase stakeholder communication frequency, improve staff morale, and effectively reduce Web app development risks.},

abstract = {The paper aims at evaluating modern DevOps tools, strategizing the execution models and monetizing the business model innovation. DevOps, with its pragmatic tools, processes, and solutions, is in the early adoption stage of the technology life cycle. At this technology innovation stage, the adopting Organizations benefit the most from the inception to execution. However, not all business firms, depending on the operating mode in the market, experience the tangential outcomes. Despite the limitations, from a technology perspective, DevOps fosters collaboration among diverse teams and eliminates cultural disparities. As a result, high-performing technology organizations deliver applications or solutions with reduced lead-times. Changing the view scope with a different lens, DevOps appears a new entrepreneurial opportunity for technology and business leaders. Combining these two seemingly disparate perspectives and invigorating the appeal strategy to the executive management for business model innovation is the core of the subject; the new frontier for influencing the consensus on technology adoption and hence, the experiential innovation for transforming business models.},

@article{Arachchi2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Agile practices with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CICD) pipeline approach has increased the efficiency of projects. In agile, new features are introduced to the system in each sprint delivery, and although it may be well developed, the delivery failures are possible due to performance issues. By considering delivery timeline, moving for system scaling is common solution in such situations. But, how much system should be scaled? System scale requires current system benchmark status and expected system status. Benchmarking the production is a critical task, as it interrupts the live system. The new version should go through a load test to measure expected system status. The traditional load test methods are unable to identify production performance behavior due to simulated traffic patterns are highly deviated from production. To overcome those issues, this approach has extended CICD pipeline to have three automation phases named benchmark, load test and scaling. It minimizes the system interruption by using test bench approach when system benchmarking and it uses the production traffic for load testing which gives more accurate results. Once benchmark and load test phases are completed, system scaling can be evaluated. Initially, the pipeline was developed using Jenkins CI server, Git repository and Nexus repository with Ansible automation. Then GoReplay is used for traffic duplication from production to test bench environment. Nagios monitoring is used to analyze the system behavior in each phase and the result of test bench has proven that scaling is capable to handle the same load while changing the application software, but it doesn't optimize response time of application at significant level and it helps to reduce the risk of application deployment by integrating this three phase approach as CICD automation extended feature. Thereby the research provides effective way to manage Agile based CICD projects.},

@article{Lwakatare2019,
abstract = {Context: DevOps is considered important in the ability to frequently and reliably update a system in operational state. DevOps presumes cross-functional collaboration and automation between software development and operations. DevOps adoption and implementation in companies is non-trivial due to required changes in technical, organisational and cultural aspects. Objectives: This exploratory study presents detailed descriptions of how DevOps is implemented in practice. The context of our empirical investigation is web application and service development in small and medium sized companies. Method: A multiple-case study was conducted in five different development contexts with successful DevOps implementations since its benefits, such as quick releases and minimum deployment errors, were achieved. Data was mainly collected through interviews with 26 practitioners and observations made at the companies. Data was analysed by first coding each case individually using a set of predefined themes and thereafter perform a cross-case synthesis. Results: Our analysis yielded some of the following results: (i) software development team attaining ownership and responsibility to deploy software changes in production is crucial in DevOps. (ii) toolchain usage and support in deployment pipeline activities accelerates the delivery of software changes, bug fixes and handling of production incidents. (ii) the delivery speed to production is affected by context factors, such as manual approvals by the product owner (iii) steep learning curve for new skills is experienced by both software developers and operations staff, who also have to cope with working under pressure. Conclusion: Our findings contributes to the overall understanding of DevOps concept, practices and its perceived impacts, particularly in small and medium sized companies. We discuss two practical implications of the results.},

@article{Luz2019,
abstract = {DevOps is a set of practices and cultural values that aims to reduce the barriers between development and operations teams. Due to its increasing interest and imprecise definitions, existing research works have tried to characterize DevOps. Nevertheless, little is known about the practitioners' understandingabout successful paths for DevOps adoption. Therefore, our goal is to detail real scenarios of DevOps adoption, presenting a theory, a model, and a case study. We used classic Grounded Theory to build a theory about 15 scenarios of successful DevOps adoption in companies from different domains and countries. We proposed a model (i.e., a workflow for DevOps adoption) and evaluated it through a case study at a Brazilian Government institution. We used a focus group to collect the company perceptions about DevOps adoption. This paper increments the existing view of DevOps by detailing real scenarios and explaining the role of each category during DevOps adoption. We provide evidence that collaboration is the core DevOps concern, contrasting with an existing wisdom that automation and tooling can be enough to achieve DevOps. Altogether, our results contribute to: generating an adequate understanding of DevOps, from the practitioners' perspective; and assisting other institutions in the path towards DevOps adoption.},
